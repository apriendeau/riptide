      <description>Earthquaker Devices, or EQD has always been a pedal company that drastically changes your tone. They are very experimental and most of the time, amazing. The Space Spiral does not drift from that line of thinking. It is analog delay with a modulated sound much like the 70&amp;rsquo;s sci-fi era.
If you are wanting a normal analog delay or don&amp;rsquo;t like the experimental sounds that EQD, then just stop reading.</description>
