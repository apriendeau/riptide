      <description>First, I have not been paid by anyone for this review.
 Gear Supply Co started as a guitar string subscription. You can choose if you would like to receive strings and picks every month, every other month or every 3rd month. Now to completely shake up their world, they have expanded to so much more than that. They sell straps, cleaning supplies, cables and strap locks. But I am going to focus on their basics.</description>
