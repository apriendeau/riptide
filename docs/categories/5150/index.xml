      <description>I am a person to steer away from signature amps because I don&amp;rsquo;t want to sound like someone else but the 5150 is really not a signature anymore. It is more of a staple in the Metal music scene. This creation of theses amps started with Peavey but EVH broke off after the contract came to an end and became its own brand. Fender is the company that currently making the current era of 5150 amps that you can purchase today.</description>
