      <description>This is out of the norm for me. I prefer tubes and boxes because of their ease of use. I maybe a programmer by day but music is my escape for that world so I tend to stear towards things that wont require a computer. With that said, I am a fan of the Boss Katana amp and how it sounded which this is based of the Katana and Waza technology.</description>
