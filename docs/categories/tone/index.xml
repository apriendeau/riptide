      <description>Oh man, pick/plectrum materials are now becoming a highly debatable topic. I never thought I would see the day but it is here. There is wood, acrylic, Celluloid, tortex, Ultex (polyetherimide), UHMWPE (Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene), Nylon, Delrin, stone, metal, bone, or glass. So, there are a bunch of big words for &amp;ldquo;fancy&amp;rdquo; plastic and a few others. I could go on but nevertheless, there is a boutique market for picks to be explored.</description>
