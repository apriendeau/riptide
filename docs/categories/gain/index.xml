      <description>No one paid me for this. Honest opinions.
Overview Misha Mansoor&amp;rsquo;s Horizon Devices released their first product a while back called the Precision Drive but people keep asking me for my opinion since I own one. This pedal is an overdrive pedal designed for modern metal, not your dad&amp;rsquo;s metal. The pedal was built by MXR, so it is definitely durable. It has passed my strenuous and thorough toddler testing system.</description>

      <title>Walrus Audio Red High-Gain Distortion</title>

      <description>I have not been paid for this review.
Overview  Walrus Audio unveiled at NAMM &amp;lsquo;17 their new distortion, &amp;ldquo;Red&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;ldquo;take no prisioners&amp;rdquo; distortion. It contains an active EQ, volume, and gain controls, along with a &amp;ldquo;texture&amp;rdquo; switch as well as true-bypass. The &amp;ldquo;texture&amp;rdquo; switch toggles between an uncompressed, overdrive-like sound and a more compressed, tightened sound.
The Pedal  I like some high-gain in my distortion pedals but this adds a little sparkle that is hard to wrap my words around it but it is what makes this pedal unique.</description>
