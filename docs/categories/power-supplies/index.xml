      <description>These are the most common questions that I get asked when people first get started.
 How should I power my pedals? Should I use 9v or 18v? Why do you need a clean power supply? What is wrong with a daisy chain?  So many questions on what you would believe to be a simple topic, right? Actually, this is where the most common mistakes are made. I have seen people fry pedals and make a really good sounding pedal sound really bad just from giving it the wrong voltage.</description>
