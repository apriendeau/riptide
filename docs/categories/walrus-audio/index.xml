      <description>I have not been paid for this review.
Overview  Walrus Audio unveiled at NAMM &amp;lsquo;17 their new distortion, &amp;ldquo;Red&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;ldquo;take no prisioners&amp;rdquo; distortion. It contains an active EQ, volume, and gain controls, along with a &amp;ldquo;texture&amp;rdquo; switch as well as true-bypass. The &amp;ldquo;texture&amp;rdquo; switch toggles between an uncompressed, overdrive-like sound and a more compressed, tightened sound.
The Pedal  I like some high-gain in my distortion pedals but this adds a little sparkle that is hard to wrap my words around it but it is what makes this pedal unique.</description>
