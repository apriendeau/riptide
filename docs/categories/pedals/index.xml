      <description>No one paid me for this. Honest opinions.
Overview Misha Mansoor&amp;rsquo;s Horizon Devices released their first product a while back called the Precision Drive but people keep asking me for my opinion since I own one. This pedal is an overdrive pedal designed for modern metal, not your dad&amp;rsquo;s metal. The pedal was built by MXR, so it is definitely durable. It has passed my strenuous and thorough toddler testing system.</description>

      <description>These are the most common questions that I get asked when people first get started.
 How should I power my pedals? Should I use 9v or 18v? Why do you need a clean power supply? What is wrong with a daisy chain?  So many questions on what you would believe to be a simple topic, right? Actually, this is where the most common mistakes are made. I have seen people fry pedals and make a really good sounding pedal sound really bad just from giving it the wrong voltage.</description>
