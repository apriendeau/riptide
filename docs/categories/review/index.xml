      <description>No one paid me for this. Honest opinions.
Overview Misha Mansoor&amp;rsquo;s Horizon Devices released their first product a while back called the Precision Drive but people keep asking me for my opinion since I own one. This pedal is an overdrive pedal designed for modern metal, not your dad&amp;rsquo;s metal. The pedal was built by MXR, so it is definitely durable. It has passed my strenuous and thorough toddler testing system.</description>

      <title>Earthquaker Devices Space Spiral</title>

      <description>Earthquaker Devices, or EQD has always been a pedal company that drastically changes your tone. They are very experimental and most of the time, amazing. The Space Spiral does not drift from that line of thinking. It is analog delay with a modulated sound much like the 70&amp;rsquo;s sci-fi era.
If you are wanting a normal analog delay or don&amp;rsquo;t like the experimental sounds that EQD, then just stop reading.</description>

      <title>What&#39;s with all the Wood?</title>

      <description>Oh man, pick/plectrum materials are now becoming a highly debatable topic. I never thought I would see the day but it is here. There is wood, acrylic, Celluloid, tortex, Ultex (polyetherimide), UHMWPE (Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene), Nylon, Delrin, stone, metal, bone, or glass. So, there are a bunch of big words for &amp;ldquo;fancy&amp;rdquo; plastic and a few others. I could go on but nevertheless, there is a boutique market for picks to be explored.</description>

      <title>Walrus Audio Red High-Gain Distortion</title>

      <description>I have not been paid for this review.
Overview  Walrus Audio unveiled at NAMM &amp;lsquo;17 their new distortion, &amp;ldquo;Red&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;ldquo;take no prisioners&amp;rdquo; distortion. It contains an active EQ, volume, and gain controls, along with a &amp;ldquo;texture&amp;rdquo; switch as well as true-bypass. The &amp;ldquo;texture&amp;rdquo; switch toggles between an uncompressed, overdrive-like sound and a more compressed, tightened sound.
The Pedal  I like some high-gain in my distortion pedals but this adds a little sparkle that is hard to wrap my words around it but it is what makes this pedal unique.</description>
