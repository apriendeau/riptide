      <description>Blue Finish  No Lacquer Finish  Lacquered Unbuffed Finish  After the first telecaster kit, I wanted to do a full kit without a pre-finished body. I am going to break this whole into a couple of posts and I want to focus on finishing a guitar and how I approached this Les Paul.I wanted a Les Paul when you could still see the flame or quilted maple and the one that I loved came out of the Gibson Custom Shop.</description>

      <description>So I decided it was time. I am tired of buying guitars that aren&amp;rsquo;t exactly what I want. I always end up replacing everything in the guitar, from the nut and the strings to the electronics. I decided that I needed a guitar with single coil pickups. I am a Stratocaster person so I decided that it was time to build a Telecaster. I like my guitars at the opposite ends of the spectrum.</description>
