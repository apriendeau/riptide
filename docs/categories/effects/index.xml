      <description>This is out of the norm for me. I prefer tubes and boxes because of their ease of use. I maybe a programmer by day but music is my escape for that world so I tend to stear towards things that wont require a computer. With that said, I am a fan of the Boss Katana amp and how it sounded which this is based of the Katana and Waza technology.</description>

      <description>No one paid me for this. Honest opinions.
Overview Misha Mansoor&amp;rsquo;s Horizon Devices released their first product a while back called the Precision Drive but people keep asking me for my opinion since I own one. This pedal is an overdrive pedal designed for modern metal, not your dad&amp;rsquo;s metal. The pedal was built by MXR, so it is definitely durable. It has passed my strenuous and thorough toddler testing system.</description>

      <description>When starting out with pedals, the hardest thing to do is decide what kind of pedalboard you should get. I struggled with this and everyone does. You don&amp;rsquo;t know where to start or what to get. When you first start digging, you will come across Velcro, mounts, or zip ties. Velcro is the most common of the three. So, I will try to explain the cons of each then let you decide for yourself.</description>

      <description>These are the most common questions that I get asked when people first get started.
 How should I power my pedals? Should I use 9v or 18v? Why do you need a clean power supply? What is wrong with a daisy chain?  So many questions on what you would believe to be a simple topic, right? Actually, this is where the most common mistakes are made. I have seen people fry pedals and make a really good sounding pedal sound really bad just from giving it the wrong voltage.</description>

      <title>Earthquaker Devices Space Spiral</title>

      <description>Earthquaker Devices, or EQD has always been a pedal company that drastically changes your tone. They are very experimental and most of the time, amazing. The Space Spiral does not drift from that line of thinking. It is analog delay with a modulated sound much like the 70&amp;rsquo;s sci-fi era.
If you are wanting a normal analog delay or don&amp;rsquo;t like the experimental sounds that EQD, then just stop reading.</description>

      <title>Walrus Audio Red High-Gain Distortion</title>

      <description>I have not been paid for this review.
Overview  Walrus Audio unveiled at NAMM &amp;lsquo;17 their new distortion, &amp;ldquo;Red&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;ldquo;take no prisioners&amp;rdquo; distortion. It contains an active EQ, volume, and gain controls, along with a &amp;ldquo;texture&amp;rdquo; switch as well as true-bypass. The &amp;ldquo;texture&amp;rdquo; switch toggles between an uncompressed, overdrive-like sound and a more compressed, tightened sound.
The Pedal  I like some high-gain in my distortion pedals but this adds a little sparkle that is hard to wrap my words around it but it is what makes this pedal unique.</description>
