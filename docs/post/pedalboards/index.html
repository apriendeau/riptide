		<h1>Pedalboards</h1>
		<div class="content">
			

<p>When starting out with pedals, the hardest thing to do is decide what kind of pedalboard you should get.
I struggled with this and everyone does. You don&rsquo;t know where to start or what to get. When you first start digging,
you will come across Velcro, mounts, or zip ties. Velcro is the most common of the three. So, I will try to explain the
cons of each then let you decide for yourself.</p>

<h2 id="velcro">Velcro<a href="#velcro" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h2>

<p>Velcro is the most common of the three that you will see, as I said before. It is easy to set up and it is easy to
remove pedals off of your board. This is the solution that you find with cheaper boards like
<a href="http://arg.wtf/2npbXzN">Pedaltrain</a>. It&rsquo;s cheap and easy. Slap one long piece of Velcro on the rails of the board
then cut smaller pieces for your pedals.</p>

<h4 id="cons">Cons<a href="#cons" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h4>

<ol>
<li>Stock rubber feet on pedals.

<ul>
<li>You will need to remove these to use Velcro. Most major companies put them on but some will ship them separately,
so it&rsquo;s hit or miss.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Adhesive

<ul>
<li>The minute that you slap Velcro on a pedal, you decrease the value. You can attempt to remove the gunk after
you remove the strip but it is very noticeable. Goo Gone is your friend.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Security

<ul>
<li>Almost every time, I can shake someone&rsquo;s board and a pedal will fall off the Velcro. This is a concern
if you travel with your board. It can damage pedals if you drop the case. It is easier for people to steal
your pedals. You have to consider most of those boxes on your board are $150 or more, on average.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="mounts">Mounts<a href="#mounts" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h2>

<p>I discovered <a href="http://arg.wtf/2npdh5S">Temple Boards</a> and if I was touring long distances, this is probably the
solution that I would go with. You stick a metal plate to your pedal that has a screw hole. The pedalboard has
holes on it. You align the mount to the hole and fasten it down with a turn screw. It uses an adhesive like Velcro
so it will have the same problems as Velcro. It claims that it doesn&rsquo;t, but I don&rsquo;t ever believe that. These
boards have a side module system that is an extra cost but is really cool. You can put your inputs and outputs
on the side so you never have to plug into a pedal, which is really nice.</p>

<h4 id="cons-1">Cons<a href="#cons-1" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h4>

<ol>
<li>Mounts

<ul>
<li>The pro about this board is also its con. You have to purchase mounts separately each time that you get a pedal.
They run between $2-3 a pop but if you have 16 pedals like I do, that&rsquo;s $58. It&rsquo;s not cheap because of the extra
cost on top of the board.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Adhesive

<ul>
<li>Same as Velcro.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="zip-ties">Zip ties<a href="#zip-ties" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h2>

<p>What? Zip ties? I had the same reaction when I came across <a href="http://arg.wtf/2noX4h7">Chemistry Design Werks Holeyboard</a>.
The board has a bunch of pre-drilled holes in it and is a two-tier board. It sits an inch off the ground. You align
the pedals between two holes the zip tie it to the board, clipping off the extra bit so you don&rsquo;t see it as much.
This removes the adhesive problem from pedals, no need to remove rubber feet from pedals or add anything to them.
Real estate is always a problem with boards but pedals with top mounted jacks are the best for this board.</p>

<h4 id="cons-2">Cons<a href="#cons-2" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h4>

<ol>
<li>Lack of Rubber Feet on pedals

<ul>
<li>This is an easy fix, but some brands do not send rubber feet at all which causes the pedals to slide.
For this system, rubber feet are essential. Luckily, they are cheap from <a href="http://arg.wtf/2mESC1q">Amazon</a>.
You can remove the feet without leaving gunk marks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Alignment

<ul>
<li>Sometimes larger pedals fit awkwardly between the holes, so it takes some fidgeting and finagling to get it to
work. 1590b pedals are best for this board.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts<a href="#final-thoughts" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h2>

<p>Well, the most common solution is Velcro. In my opinion, that Velcro is the worst one of the three. If you are
touring heavily, then I recommend going with mounts. But if you are just playing local gigs and at home,
then I would seriously recommend giving the Holeyboard a look. It is cheap for the size of the board and
you can buy 100 zip ties for $10. It allows you to resell pedals for a higher value. If you are like me and
want some serious organization with extra features, Temple Boards are amazing. You can choose to use the mounts
or put velcro on the top.</p>
