The Lillian is an analog, multi-stage phaser that from it's sister pedal, the Julia where you can blend between
Dry, Phase Shifted, and Vibrato. It has switch to select between 4 stages which is warm and tightened to 6 stages
which is more lush and thicker.


## Knobs

The Rate knob controls the Low Frequency Oscillator (LFO) speed from a steady pace to crazy past speeds. The
Width knob controls the range of which frequencies are allowed to pass through; the higher the setting creates
a larger phasing effect. The Feedback knob controls how much much signal gets back through the phase stages.
The lower the settings will provide more of classic phaser sounds where as the high settings is where the fun
happens. The D-P-V knob was described earlier, which was borrowed from the Julia. It allows you to blend between Dry,
Phase Shifted, and Vibrato.
